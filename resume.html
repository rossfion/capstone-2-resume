                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>Why hire me as a Full Stack Web Developer? I have freelanced for ten years in a variety of fields, and taught Business Management, Information Technology (IT) and Media/Multimedia Technology for more than 12 years. In addition to this, I have been building websites since 2005 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch as well as with frameworks. Furthermore, I have spent the last nine years maintaining a custom-built content management system with a front-end to support the work of the late African-American artist Morgan Monceaux.
                </p>
                <p>After teaching IT and running my own business for over fifteen years, I finally got an opportunity to spend a lot more time creating and developing my own portfolio while educating myself to stay relevant as well as formalizing my experience to date.
                </p>
                <p>At the moment, this is being achieved through completing the Web Developer 2023 Bootcamp Udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu of the London App Brewery, UK.
                </p>
                <p>With my skills and experience, I am sure I can contribute to the success of any company and welcome any opportunities to show how I can help you reach your goals.
                </p>
                <p>Authorized to work in the USA for any employer (Permanent Resident status).</p>
                <p>100% remote work strongly preferred.
